# Overview
I want to learn some basic data scicence skills within the next 4 months.(August 2019 to November 2019)
Once the Australian Summer arrives I find it hard to focus on studying and tend to spend more time outdoors

My plan is to study hard for 4 months and then take a well deserved break in December.
